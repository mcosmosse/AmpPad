NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

The day’s at the morn.”\n    “I guess you did. Do you remember it’s Good Friday?”\n    He said hollowly, “The dirty Romans are forming up for Calvary.”\n    “Don’t be sacrilegious. Will Marullo let you close the store at eleven?”\n    “Darling chicken-flower—Marullo is a Catholic and a wop. He probably won’t show up at all. I’ll close at noon till the execution’s over.”\n    “That’s Pilgrim talk. It’s not nice.”\n    “Nonsense, ladybug. That’s from my mother’s side. That’s pirate talk. It was an execution, you know.”\n    “They were not pirates. You said yourself, whalers, and you said they had letters of what-you-call-it from the Continental Congress.”\n    “The ships they fired on thought they were pirates.
